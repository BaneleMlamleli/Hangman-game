# Hangman-game

This is a text-based game that I created when I was still learning C++. I used CodeBlocks to develop the game. Anyone can use pieces of the code or the entire game in anyway they desire. You can probably credit me if you need to :-)
I actually used my alias name, "Cipher", since this was my personal project and at the time I new nothing about GitHub or any version control system for that matter.
